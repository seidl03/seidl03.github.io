			<h2 style="text-align:center;"> About This Site</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:150px; margin-right:150px; text-align:center;"> I created this site for a school project. I didn't want to do a
				standard "about me" website, so I pondered for another idea. After a little while, I 
				thought of my love for fun facts and puns. Alas I could create a site themed around 
				them and so this site was born. I did have fun figuring out how html works and how
				to use css to style everything. I will admit that everything probably isn't set up properly, but it works.
				I hope you enjoy learning some fun facts while checking out the my site!</p>
